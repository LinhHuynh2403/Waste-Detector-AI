# ♻️ Trash Sorting AI (Recyclable vs Non-Recyclable)
UC Davis Computer Vision project that uses a pretrained CNN to classify waste (plastic, glass, paper, etc.) into recyclable vs. non-recyclable for promoting environmental sustainability.

## 🧠 Project Overview
This project aims to demonstrate how **AI can support environmental sustainability** by automatically classifying waste items (plastic, glass, paper, cardboard, metal, etc.).  
Instead of building a model from scratch, it uses **transfer learning** with pretrained models like **ResNet18** or **MobileNetV2** for efficient and accurate classification.

## 📊 Dataset
**Dataset:** [TrashNet](https://www.kaggle.com/code/lutfianaorinnijhum/trashnet-cnn/notebook)  
**Dataset:** [TrashNet V2](https://www.kaggle.com/code/akhileshs111111/trashnet-v2/input)  
- Contains 6 waste categories: *plastic, paper, metal, glass, cardboard, trash*  
- Used to train a model that outputs either:
  - 6-class waste type classification, or  
  - Simplified **recyclable vs non-recyclable** labels  

*(Note: Dataset not included in the repo due to size limits. Please download it from Kaggle.)*

## ⚙️ Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Resize and normalize images  
   - Apply data augmentation (rotation, flip, brightness)  

2. **Model Training**
   - Use a pretrained CNN (ResNet18 / MobileNetV2)  
   - Fine-tune the final layers for our dataset  
   - Train using categorical cross-entropy loss  

3. **Evaluation**
   - Accuracy and confusion matrix  
   - Grad-CAM visualization for interpretability  

4. **Output**
   - Classifies image as *Recyclable* or *Non-Recyclable*

## Important Folders

### 1. `results/` (Output Data)

| File | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `trash_sorting_finetuned_model.pth` | **Model Checkpoint.** Contains the learned weights of the fine-tuned ResNet18 model. |
| `training_metrics.csv` (or specified by `--output` argument) | **Metrics Log.** A human-readable CSV file logging the Loss, Accuracy, Epochs, and Learning Rate for every epoch of the training run. |
| `training_metrics.json` | **Plotting Data.** A JSON file containing the loss and accuracy lists, used as input for the `plot_metrics.py` script. |
| `class_names.json` | **Class Mapping.** A list of class names used to map the model's numerical output index (0, 1, 2,...) back to the human-readable garbage category. |

### 2. `src/` (Source Code)

| Script | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `training.py` | **Main Training Script.** Handles data loading, model instantiation (ResNet18), the training loop, printing epoch results, and saving all final assets (`.csv`, `.pth`, `.json`). Accepts `--epochs` and `--lr` arguments for hyperparameter sweep. |
| `utils.py` | **Utility Functions.** Contains reusable components like the image pre-processing pipelines (`val_transform`), the function to build the ResNet18 model architecture (`build_model`), and the function to load the saved model checkpoint for inference (`load_checkpoint_model`). |
| `test.py` | **Inference/Testing Script.** Loads the trained model from the `results/` folder and performs predictions on a list of individual images (defined by `TEST_IMAGE_PATHS`). |
| `plot_metrics.py` | **Visualization Script.** Loads the training metrics from `results/training_metrics.json` and generates a plot visualizing the Training/Validation Loss and Accuracy over all epochs. |
